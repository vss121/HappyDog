## EKC 2023 Abstract
### Title
A Medical Walking Habit Game for the Treatment of Depression
### Content
Depression is one of the prevalent mental health issues in modern society, causing patients to experience an increasing loss of interest and motivation in everyday activities. The impact of COVID-19 social distancing measures has worsened mental health problems such as depression and anxiety due to social isolation and the uncertainty brought about by the pandemic [1]. Currently, South Korea has maintained the highest suicide rate among OECD countries for over a decade [2]. Given that depression is a psychological and psychiatric factor, it is closely correlated with suicide rates [3]. Therefore, we are conducting research and designing a medical walking habit game that could potentially serve as a solution to this problem. 

The objective of this game is to assist patients with depression in going outdoors, getting exposure to sunlight, and forming a habit of taking walks, ultimately alleviating their depression [4]. Additionally, interacting with a virtual dog in the game helps improve users' mental well-being by nurturing the pet within the game [5]. Through various missions and reward systems, users engage in an effective and sustainable therapeutic process. Ultimately, the game aims to promote physical activity in an enjoyable way, with the goal of alleviating depression in patients.

During the initial game setup or when the virtual dog reaches certain levels, regular depression scale assessments are conducted to monitor the level of depression. The dog-walking feature encourages outdoor physical activity by providing real-time GPS information to track the user's actual distance and time of movement. Users are rewarded with in-game experience points and virtual currency based on the distance and time they spend walking with their virtual dogs. Whenever the user reaches specific locations marked on the map while walking their virtual dog, they receive random comforting messages as collectible items. Moreover, there are several other interactive features with the virtual dog, such as the ability to chat with the virtual pet using ChatGPT, feed the dog, give it a bath, and show affection. This way, the game is expected to play an effective role as a supportive tool for maintaining the mental health of patients with depression, aiding them in overcoming social isolation and depression.
